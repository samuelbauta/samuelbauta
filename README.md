## About Me

I am a **coder** focused on creating clean, intuitive, and thoughtful experiences.  
I believe that good design is invisible — the user should notice only what matters.  

Currently exploring:  
- Modern frameworks and tools  
- Elegant, human-centric design  
- AI and automation to simplify workflows
